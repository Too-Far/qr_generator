# qr_generator

Used to create QR codes. Able to modify code to create qr codes for whatever you need. 
Some ideas include:
    social media handles
    websites
    links to google maps
    WIFI login info (the current iteration provided)
Plans for the future:
    I would like to incorporate this into a flask based application to allow users to input data to be made into a qr code. 

Huge nod to the blog in Kite (https://kite.com/blog/python/creating-3d-printed-wifi-access-qr-codes-with-python/) for the tutorial.
